# Stack-Trace-Error-based-DoS-Exploit
PoC: DoS By Stack Trace Error

Stack Trace error's increase the error log file on the Remote File, sometimes in KB's with every error.
this Exploiter will automatically repeat the requests to the URL which triggers the Error and therefor increasing the error log file on the server very fast making this a resource consuming dos attack.

On some hosting providers which have set a resource limit it might be possible to get the website temporary suspended by consuming all of its memory resources, however to make this attack real efficient it should be coded to be multithreaded which it is not yet... its up to other GitHub security enthousiasts to fork this project and make something better out of it.

Anyways, so far this should be good enough to be used as a Proof-of-Concept in Responsible Disclosure programs.

as always, stay ethical guys!
